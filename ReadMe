## Aim of the project

The aim of this project is to model lung cancer prevalence and to discern features that are strongly associated with lung cancer.


## Project, motivation

Investigating lung cancer cases is crucial due to its public health implications. This work is motivated to obtain insights about the underlying drivers of lung prevalence. 


## Data

We used data reported by Bridson et al., see the GitHub https://github.com/indranil09/VA_LungCancer_INLA. The data are obtained from the features 


1. Demographics: Gender (F, M), Race (Black, White, Other), Ethnicity (Hispanic, Latino, Not Hispanic or Latino), Age

               That is,  Percentage of males, Percentage of Blacks, Percentage of Whites, Percentage of Hispanics

               The impact of race, specifically Black or White, on the prevalence of Lung cancer was measured against the category ‚ÄòOther‚Äô, which includes Asian, Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders (NHPI), American Indian and Alaska Natives, some other race alone, and two or more races

                The effect of age will be incorporated into the model through the variable such as percentage of population with age ‚â• 65

2. Prevalence of Binge Drinking, Smoking, and Obesity

3. Percent Population below Poverty

4. Social Deprivation Index (SDI): 

              It quantify the socioeconomic variation in health outcomes

              It is a deprivation based on seven demographic characteristics

              The seven demographic characteristics include:

                        * Percent living in poverty
                        * Percent with less than 12 years of education
                        * Percent single-parent households
                        * Percent living in rented housing units
                        * Percent living in overcrowded housing units
                        * Percent of households without a car and
                        * Percent unemployed adults under 65 years of age
              Its value range from 1 to 100, with higher values reflecting greater deprivation

5. Average Daily Air Quality PM2.5 Concentration: Particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less


## Modelling

If we define the number of cases  ùëå in terms of the population  ùëÅ with a given intensity (or incidence rate)  ùúÜ, we assume that cases  ùëå
arise as a Poisson process with rate  ùúÜ, which represents the expected number of cases per individual in the population  ùëÅ. Thus, we can use generalized linear model with regularization to select features and obtain insight
the data. We also used XGBoost Poisson Regression to model the prevalence lung cancer using the selected features and to learn the relative importance of features that are associated with lung cancer prevalence.


## Result

The study result suggests that features such as  

   * Median_Household_Income
   * ZCTA_pm2_5 
   * OBESITY_CrudePrev
   * Pct_Population_Female_65andOver
   * Pct_Hisp_Female_Between18and65 
   * CSMOKING_CrudePrev
   * BINGE_CrudePrev
   * Pct_Population_Male_65andOver 
   * Pct_Hisp_Female_65andOver
   * sdi_score
   * Pct_White_Male_Between18and65
   * Pct_White_65andOver
   * Pct_White_Male_65andOver
   * Pct_Hisp_65andOver 
   * Pct_Black_Female_Between18and65
   * Pct_White_Female_Between18and65 
   * Pct_Black_Female_65andOver
   * Pct_Hisp_Male_Between18and65
   * Pct_BelowPoverty_18andOver

 are strong association with lung cancer prevalence


## Executive summary

Introduction: Lung cancer is one of the most critical and pressing public health challenges.  This study analyzes and models the prevalence of lung cancer using a combination of demographic, behavioral, and socioeconomic features.\\


Goal: To discern demographic, behavioral, socioeconomic and environmental drivers of lung cancer incidence in Virginia counties (2014-2018) and build predictive models to inform public health policy.\\

Data overview: County-level aggregated counts of lung cancer cases among populations 18 and older, with data derived from the following domains: \textit{Demographic} (\% Male, \% Female, \% Black, \% White, \% Hispanic, \% aged 65+); \textit{Behavioral} (Prevalence of Smoking, Binge Drinking, and Obesity),  \textit{Socioeconomic} (\% Poverty rate, Social Deprivation Index (SDI), Median Household Income), and  \textit{Environmental} (PM2.5 Air Quality ($\mu$g/m$^3$)).
We preprocessed the data by removing missing values, performing feature engineering, and scaling the features to better capture the features that drive cancer incidence.\\



Modelling Approach: Poisson generalized linear model with elastic net, which combines $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ penalties, is used for feature selection. XGBoost with a Poisson loss function, a boosted tree model tuned for count data, is proposed to improve predictive accuracy and identify features that drive lung cancer prevalence. After splitting the processed data into training (70\%) and testing (30\%) sets, both models are trained on the training data with five-fold cross-validation, and their hyperparameters are tuned using mean absolute error.\\


Implementation: We used several Python packages to preprocess the data and train the models. For XGBoost, we incorporated a custom loss function into the existing implementation to train the proposed model tailored to our problem.\\


Results: The results from the \textbf{Poisson generalized linear model with elastic net regularization} suggest strong positive associations between lung cancer prevalence and features such as smoking rates, the proportion of the population aged 65 and older, and the proportions of older Black and White individuals in the population under study. In contrast, negative associations are observed with poverty rates and the proportion of Hispanic individuals. Using \textbf{XGBoost with a Poisson loss function}, we achieved improved predictive performance, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.963 compared to 6.313 from the GLM, representing a 5.44\% improvement. The most important features identified by the XGBoost model include median household income, PM2.5 levels, smoking rates, and obesity prevalence. These features consistently demonstrated strong predictive power, underscoring their central role in explaining variation in lung cancer prevalence.\\

Conclusion: Lung cancer prevalence is driven by a combination of demographic, behavioural, and environmental features. Structural inequality and public health behaviours, such as smoking, are key contributors to cancer incidence. Machine learning techniques, when combined with domain knowledge, enhance the predictive accuracy of cancer prevalence.\\

Recommendation: To reduce lung cancer incidence, it is essential to prioritize interventions for high-risk groups, such as older adults, smokers, and communities facing environmental and economic stress. Besides, integrating behavioural and environmental health data into cancer prevention programs is crucial.


## Future work

This work can be extended by incorporating spatial information into the model. This approach may help us better understand the drivers of lung cancer prevalence and visualize the spatial distribution of lung cancer incidence in the study area..
